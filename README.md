# Password Manager

--- 

Simple password manager written in Java as a personal project. Spin-off of [1Password][1], called 2Password! 

It includes a *very* simple GUI made with Swing, and a few functionalities such as:
- Adding and Storing a given password
- Generating and Storing a password when given desired password length
- Removing selected passwords
- Renaming selected passwords
- Copying selected passwords to system clipboard

---

### Requires initial master password that cannot be changed

#### Still to add:
- Requiring 2 master passwords in order to access dashboard
- No reason to do that other than to stay true to its name
